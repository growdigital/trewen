  <h1>Ysgol Trewen WordPress intro</h1>

  <p>To login, go to <a href="http://ysgoltrewen.uk/wp/wp-admin/">ysgoltrewen.uk/wp/wp-admin/</a>. There is a user called <code>editor</code> for editing content.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://ysgoltrewen.uk/">Ysgol Trewen website</a> is powered by <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, the world’s most popular, <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#gpl">free</a>, website software. See <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page#Learn_How_to_Use_WordPress">their website</a> for learning how to get started with WordPress.</p>

  <p>There are currently three pages on the Ysgol Trewen site: home, dates and staff.</p>

  <p>The home and dates page use the same format: each <code>Image and text</code> row is an image, caption &amp; text. At the bottom of the content is a button to add another row.</p>

  <p>To insert a photo, upload it first to the <a href="http://ysgoltrewen.uk/wp/wp-admin/upload.php">Media Library</a> in the highest resolution at <strong>16:9 aspect ratio</strong>, and then select it from the Media Library via the <code>Add Image</code> button.</p>

  <p>The staff page has a row for each member of staff, with the name, title and photo.</p>

  <p>You can edit Global content for <a href="http://ysgoltrewen.uk/wp/wp-admin/admin.php?page=global-term-dates">Term dates</a>, <a href="http://ysgoltrewen.uk/wp/wp-admin/admin.php?page=global-school-details">School details</a> and <a href="http://ysgoltrewen.uk/wp/wp-admin/admin.php?page=global-footer">Footer</a>. Global content is used in more than one place.</p>

  <p>To handle multilingual content, the Ysgol Trewen site uses the <a href="https://wpml.org/">WPML</a> plugin which has been donated by WPML to the school. </p>

  <p>With Global content, you can flip between Welsh and English in the top menu bar:</p>

  <p>With Pages, you can also click on the pencil edit icon in the list of pages or on the page itself.</p>

  <p>There are plans to use the News page for creating “activity posts” with photos in a future version of the website. </p>
